Setup with venv

# setup virtualenv -- recommended
virtualenv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
# ...
```

Changes vs old API

* does not do revisions (not a part of the official API)
* stub's all revision calls to just asset calls

Known bugs:

* Lightroom API doesn't keep captureDate -- it resets it to nothing on upload_media_file
